# Airline_Reservation_Desktop_Application

An airline reservation system project in Java is a computer program that allows airlines to store and manage reservations made by passengers. 

It typically includes a user interface that allows passengers to search for flights, and make reservations, as well as a backend database to store information about flights, passengers, and reservations.

In a Java-based airline reservation system project, the system would be implemented using the Java programming language. It might also make use of other technologies, such as databases (e.g. MySQL).

Overall, the goal of an airline reservation system project is to create a functional and user-friendly system that helps airlines manage their operations and enables passengers to easily book flights and manage their travel plans.
